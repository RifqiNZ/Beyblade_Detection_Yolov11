# Beyblade Detection and Battle Data Logging

This project uses a pre-trained YOLO model to detect and analyze Beyblade fights in a video. It processes the video frames, detects the spinning Beyblades, tracks their movements, and logs the battle outcomes into a CSV file.

## Project Structure
1. **YOLO Model**: The project uses the YOLO model for object detection, which has been pre-trained on a Beyblade dataset.
2. **Video Processing**: The project processes a video file frame by frame to detect objects in real time.
3. **Battle Logging**: The results of each battle (e.g., duration, winner, and cause) are saved in a CSV file.

## Files
- **run.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook that contains the code for detecting Beyblade activities in the video and logging the battle data.
- **beyblade_battle_data_pandas.csv**: CSV file generated by the notebook that contains details about each battle.

## Code Breakdown

### 1. Import Libraries
The project imports the following essential libraries:
- `YOLO`: For loading the pre-trained YOLO model and performing object detection.
- `cv2`: For video processing and frame capturing.
- `csv`: For saving battle data in CSV format.
- `time`: For managing time data such as battle duration.
- `pandas`: For handling and saving data in a DataFrame.

### 2. Load YOLO Model and Video
The YOLO model is loaded from a specified file path, and the video is loaded using OpenCV:
```python
model = YOLO('/path/to/best.pt')
video = '/path/to/video.mp4'
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video)
```

### 3. Prepare CSV File for Battle Data
A CSV file is initialized with the following columns:
- `Battle Number`: Tracks the battle number.
- `Duration (s)`: Duration of the battle in seconds.
- `Winner`: Identifies the winner (either Red or Blue Beyblade).
- `Cause`: The reason for winning (e.g., spinning outside the arena).
- `Fight Count`: The number of "fights" detected in the battle.

### 4. Detect Beyblade Moving Outside the Arena
The function `is_out_of_arena` determines whether a Beyblade has moved outside the predefined arena boundaries. It checks the bounding box coordinates of the detected object and returns `True` if the Beyblade is out of bounds:
```python
def is_out_of_arena(bbox):
    x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max = bbox
    if x_min < arena_top_left[0] or y_min < arena_top_left[1] or x_max > arena_bottom_right[0] or y_max > arena_bottom_right[1]:
        return True
    return False
```

### 5. Save Data to CSV
The function `save_to_dataframe_csv` saves the battle data (e.g., battle number, duration, winner, cause, and fight count) to a Pandas DataFrame, which is then exported to a CSV file:
```python
def save_to_dataframe_csv(battle_data):
    global battle_df
    new_row = pd.DataFrame([battle_data], columns=columns)
    battle_df = pd.concat([battle_df, new_row], ignore_index=True)
    battle_df.to_csv('beyblade_battle_data_pandas.csv', index=False)
```

### 6. Frame-by-Frame Video Processing
The project processes each frame of the video using YOLO detection to identify Beyblades, track their positions, and determine if they spin outside the arena. Battle outcomes are recorded based on the object movements detected in the frames.

## How to Run
1. Load the Jupyter Notebook (`run.ipynb`).
2. Ensure the YOLO model (`best.pt`) is in the correct path.
3. Update the video path to the location of your Beyblade video.
4. Run the notebook. The results will be saved in a CSV file (`beyblade_battle_data_pandas.csv`).

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the detection accuracy by fine-tuning the YOLO model on a larger dataset.
- Implement additional logic for more complex battle outcome detection.
- Visualize the detection and battle results in real-time.
